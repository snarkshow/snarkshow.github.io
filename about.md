Hi, I'm Laura.

I'm a web developer with a background in legal and corporate research.

I'm committed to writing precise and exacting code in the service of clean and accessible design.  

I'm skilled in project management (CAPM), non-profit bookkeeping, and I'm always looking for new ways to dedicate time and energy to my professional community.
